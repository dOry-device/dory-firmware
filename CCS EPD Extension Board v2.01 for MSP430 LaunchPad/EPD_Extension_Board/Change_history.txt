 * The following is a summary of the changes made to the MSP430 LaunchPad with EPD Extension Kit.
 * The changes are listed with the most recent first.
 * - <b>Version 2.00 - 30 Jan, 2015</b>\n
 *   -# Upgrade MSP430 compiler to v4.4.3
 *   -# Added Nothing Frame function at the power off stage for G2_Aurora_Mb
 * - <b>Version 2.00 - 30 Jan, 2015</b>\n
 *   -# Upgrade CCS to 6.0.1 and MSP430 compiler to v4.3.5
 *   -# Change naming convention: V110=Vizplex, V230=Aurora Ma, V231=Aurora Mb
 *   -# Add supporting MSP-EXP430F5529LP LaunchPad
 *   -# Add driving waveform of Aurora Mb and with G1, G2
 *   -# Move all configurations to conf_EPD.h
 *   -# Support new sizes of 1.9" and 2.6"
 *   -# The power off sequence is different from the previous Vizplex version
 *   -# The low temperature (-5 to -25C) driving waveform for Aurora_Ma is TBD.
 *   -# Change partial update method to one stage and configurable stage time
 *   -# Move original EPD_hardware_GPIO.* into EPD_hardware_driver.*
 *   -# Rename original EPD_controller.* as EPD_interface.*. Some functions were moved to EPD_Gx_Aurora_Mx.c
 * - <b>Version 1.11 - 10 Mar, 2014</b>\n
 *   -# Upgrade CCS compiler from v4.2.2 to v4.2.3
 *   -# Check Flash is busy before any access (Mem_Flash.c)
 *   -# Adjust the block size of 2.7" (EPD_COG_process_v230_G2.c)
 *   -# Use the 1st image array for V230 G2 2.7" EPD only if running without EPD Kit Tool due to exceed code size of MSP430
 *   -# Fixed turning on OE command to (0x02, 0x07) in dummy_line function in EPD_COG_process_v230_G2.c
 * - <b>Version 1.10 - 7 Feb, 2014</b>\n
 *   -# Added new G2 COG driving waveform code to support V230 EPD for 2" and 2.7"
 *   -# Disabled the ASCII partial update function when connecting with V230 G2 EPD and working with EPD Kit Tool
 *      due to G2 hasn't supported partial update yet(7Feb'14).
 * - <b>Version 1.01 - 14 Nov, 2013</b>\n
 *   -# Upgraded compiler version to v4.2.2 on CCS v5.5
 *   -# Removed the default NULL static of _On_EPD_read_flash (CCS v5.5 doesn't work)
 *   -# Added if(slideshow_parameter.EPD_size>EPD_270) return; code in EPD_Kit_Tool_process_init(). 
 *      If the default EPD size of slideshow parameter is greater than EPD_270, the LaunchPad can't get connection.
 *   -# Fixed the memory access method
 *   -# Add "Known issue" section in quick start guide of main.c
 * - <b>Version 1.00 - 3 Jun, 2013</b>\n
 *   -# Separate the COG driving code into COG_V110(default), COG_V110G2(future) and COG_V230(future) structure
 *   -# Separate the source code into two running modes: (1)image arrays, (2)EPD Kit Tool
 *   -# Restructure code files and definitions 
 *   -# Give detail comments in codes and generate Doxygen document
 * - <b>Version 0.92 - 18 Feb, 2013</b>\n
 *   -# First release of EPD Extension board with MSP430 LaunchPad kit.
